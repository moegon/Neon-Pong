# Neon Pong

A quick JS game to teach basic game development and a small browser-based neon-style Pong demo implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Files
- `index.html` — game container and layout.
- `script.js` — game logic and input handling.
- `styles.css` — neon-inspired styling and layout.

How to run
1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
   - From a file manager: double-click `index.html`.
   - From the command line (recommended for some browsers):

```bash
# Serve on a local HTTP server (recommended to avoid CORS and file:// issues)
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Controls
- Player 1: `W` (up), `S` (down)
- Player 2: `Arrow Up` (up), `Arrow Down` (down)

Customization
- Tweak `styles.css` to change colors and layout.
- Edit `script.js` to change ball speed, paddle size, and scoring.
